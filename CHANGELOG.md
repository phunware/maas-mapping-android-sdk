## Version 2.5.0 (2015-08-31)

#### Bug fixes / performance enhancements
* Added support for turn-by-turn directions. Turn-by-turn maneuvers can be accessed by accessing the maneuvers property on a PWRoute object. You can plot a route maneuver on a PWMapView intance by calling setRouteManeuver: with a valid PWRouteManeuver object. All previous route behavior is still present and unaffected. Please see the turn-by-turn sample as an example of how to implement turn-by-turn.
 **NOTE**: You will need to plot a route maneuever in order to enter turn-by-turn mode.
* Route maneuvers switch automatically when location upates are available and the indoor user tracking mode is set to PWIndoorUserTrackingModeFollow or PWIndoorUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading. You can manually set route maneuvers if desired but that will set the indoor user tracking mode to PWIndoorUserTrackingModeNone.
* Added new class, PWRouteManeuever. A route maneuver encapsulates information related to given maneuver such as turn direction, distance and other information.
* Route steps are now automatically selected by the SDK in response to user initiated floor changes or location updates. A new callback has been created when a route step changes.
* Added PwBuildingMapManager callback PwBuildingMapManager:onPwRouteStepChangedCallback:onRouteStepChanged. This method is called whenever the PWRouteStep being displayed by the map view changes.
* Added PwBuildingMapManager callback PwBuildingMapManager:onmaneuverchangedCallback:onManeuverChanged. This method is called whenever the PWRouteManeuver being displayed by the map changes.
* When registering a PWGPSLocationManager with the map view the location will now show on all floors regardless of whether or not there is a valid floorIDMapping match.
*  Updated MaaSLocation SDK to '1.2.0'
* Fixed Bug for getting route from  and to same floor number in different buildings.
* Added property to PWDirectionsOptions called excludedPointIdentifiers. Specify an array of point identifiers that you would like to exclude from routing. Please see PWDirectionsOptions header for more information.

* Added `setBlueDotSmoothingEnabled` method to `PwBuildingMapManager` for toggling blue dot.
